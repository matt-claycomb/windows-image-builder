Windows Imaging Tools
===============================

# NOTE: This is a WIP fork of https://github.com/cloudbase/windows-openstack-imaging-tools/ which I am trimming down and changing some.

Windows Imaging Tools automates the generation of Windows images.<br/>
The tools are a bundle of PowerShell modules and scripts.

The generation environment needs to be a Windows one, with Hyper-V virtualization enabled.

## Fast path to create a Windows image

### Requirements:

* A Windows host, with Hyper-V virtualization enabled, PowerShell >=v4 support<br/>
and Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)
* A Windows installation ISO or DVD
* Windows compatible drivers, if required by the target environment
* Git environment

### Steps to generate the Windows image
* Clone this repository
* Mount or extract the Windows ISO file
* Download and / or extract the Windows compatible drivers
* If the image generation is configured to install updates,<br/>
the WindowsUpdates git submodule ia required.<br/>
Run `git submodule update --init` to retrieve them
* Import the WinImageBuilder.psm1 module
* Use the New-WindowsCloudImage or New-WindowsOnlineCloudImage methods with <br/> the appropriate configuration file

### PowerShell image generation example for OpenStack KVM (host requires Hyper-V enabled)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/cloudbase/windows-openstack-imaging-tools.git
pushd windows-openstack-imaging-tools
Import-Module .\WinImageBuilder.psm1
Import-Module .\Config.psm1
Import-Module .\UnattendResources\ini.psm1
# Create a config.ini file using the built in function, then set them accordingly to your needs
$ConfigFilePath = ".\config.ini"
New-WindowsImageConfig -ConfigFilePath $ConfigFilePath

# To automate the config options setting:
Set-IniFileValue -Path (Resolve-Path $ConfigFilePath) -Section "DEFAULT" `
                                      -Key "wim_file_path" `
                                      -Value "D:\Sources\install.wim"
# Use the desired command with the config file you just created

New-WindowsOnlineImage -ConfigFilePath $ConfigFilePath

popd

```

## Image generation workflow

### New-WindowsCloudImage

This command does not require Hyper-V to be enabled, but the generated image<br/>
is not ready to be deployed, as it needs to be started manually on another hypervisor.<br/>
The image is ready to be used when it shuts down.

### New-WindowsOnlineImage
This command requires Hyper-V to be enabled, a VMSwitch to be configured for external<br/>
network connectivity if the updates are to be installed, which is highly recommended.

This command uses internally the `New-WindowsCloudImage` to generate the base image and<br/>
start a Hyper-V instance using the base image. After the Hyper-V instance shuts down, <br/>
the resulting VHDX is shrinked to a minimum size and converted to the required format.
